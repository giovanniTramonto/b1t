      <p>I am an independent Typeface Designer and Font Engineer. I also do practice letters the analog way.</p>
      <p>I work on type projects, commissioned or self-initiated.</p>
      <p>I am specialised in extending Latin typefaces and logos to different writing systems, such as Greek, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Bengali, Georgian or Tamil.</p>
      <p>I have graduated in graphic and type design from the Écoles <a href="https://duperre.org/">Duperré</a>, <a href="http://www.ecole-estienne.paris/">Estienne</a> and <a href="https://www.ensad.fr/en">ENSAD</a> in Paris. I later pursued my studies in typography at the <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/typography/">University of Reading</a> (UK) obtaining there a Master in Typeface Design. While working in Los Angeles at <a href="https://www.chasedesigngroup.com/">Chase Design Group</a>, I assisted typeface development for <a href="https://luxtypo.com/">Lux Typo</a>. Moving to London, I joined the design team at <a href="https://www.daltonmaag.com/">Dalton Maag</a> for five years. As Senior Designer, I was in charge of the development of many Indic fonts. Nokia Pure Bengali was notably awarded with the 3rd prize in the Indic category at the <a href="http://www.granshan.com/competition-2014-%E2%80%93-winners">Granshan</a> competition in 2014. The whole studio also received during that time the Graphics Award 2012 from the <a href="https://designmuseum.org/">Design Museum</a>. Between 2015 and 2018, I was then part of <a href="https://www.monotype.com/">Monotype</a> as Font Engineer and Designer.</p>
      <p>I am also an active member of <a href="http://www.alphabettes.org/">Alphabettes</a> and <a href="https://www.atypi.org/">ATypI</a>. From 2018 on, I am invited at <a href="http://www.ecole-estienne.paris/">École Estienne</a> as a member judging the DSAA Dessin Typographique. In 2019 I will also be part of the jury at <a href="http://www.esad-amiens.fr/">ÉSAD Amiens</a> for the Post-Graduate in type design. Additionally, I conduct workshops and give lectures about world typography and my experiences as a designer; the last <a href="https://vimeo.com/279407187">talk</a> I gave was at <a href="https://vimeo.com/283923364">Kerning Conference</a>, in June 2018.</p>
